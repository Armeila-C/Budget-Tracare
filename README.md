Money has become a very crucial aspect of living as it allows us to buy the necessities of life such as food, clothing, and shelter. It is considered to be significant as, without money, we would not be able to pursue our education, pay for medications, and avail of important services in the market. Generally, money revolves around everything that we do and acquire. 

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, budgeting is the process of calculating how much money you must earn or save during a particular time, and of planning how you will spend it [1]. Students need to learn the basics of budgeting so that they will have sufficient money to buy the things they need in the future.
